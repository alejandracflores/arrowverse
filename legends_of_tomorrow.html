However, they learn that another time-travelling team called the Legion of Doom, consisting of Eobard Thawne / Reverse Flash, Damien Darhk, Malcolm Merlyn, and a past version of Snart, are after the Biblical Spear of Destiny so they can alter their fates. Along the way, the Legends are joined by Justice Society of America member Amaya Jiwe / Vixen and modern-day historian Nate Heywood, who later acquires the power to become solid metal and takes the name Steel. After defeating the Legion of Doom, Rip leaves the team and Sara becomes the Legends' captain.</p>

He also informs them that Nora Darhk has resurrected her father, Damien, as well as recruited Amaya's villainous granddaughter, Kuasa, and enemy of the Flash, Gorilla Grodd, so that they can release the demon, Mallus. Though the team loses Firestorm, they are joined by Zari Tomaz, a hacktivist from 2042 who wields an air-controlling amulet, and Wally West / Kid Flash, a speedster who trained under the Flash. Time Bureau agent and later director Ava Sharpe also starts working closely with the team, entering a relationship with Sara. Upon defeating Mallus, Amaya returns home to Zambesi while Wally departs to find his own way.</p>
